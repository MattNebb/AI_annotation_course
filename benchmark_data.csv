15241,"Susan McIntyre ""Susan McIntyre""","Negative","There is no one with celiac or gluten intolerance or lactose intolerance in my family, so I cannot really speak for the value of this product for them.  As for me, I don't think this is worth the money.<br /><br />Here are my test results:<br /><br />My 2 year old grandson loved them.  The 6 year old rejected them handily.<br />I only tasted them lightly for reasons I will list below.<br />They are gluten free and non dairy if you need that.<br />They contain organic ingredients if that is what you are looking for<br /><br />But:<br />They have 8 g of sugars and these sugars are very heavy on the fructose.  Both agave and coconut sugars are 60 to 90% fructose.  Now, I choose not to argue with anybody who wants to defend fructose.  I am fructose intolerant so I dare not to even try eating these because of that.  I have read a lot of scientific literature about fructose and I have my opinions and the corn council has theirs.<br />They have 180 calories per 40 gram serving which is too much for a snack for my purposes.  Yes, eating half would be only 90 calories, but half is barely a bite.<br /><br />Here is the kicker:  they have only 2 g of protein per serving so they would not be a good exchange for a meal.<br /><br />I tend to buy a far cheaper store brand version of Quaker oats granola bars. Ounce for ounce they have about the same amount of sugar and fat, far less saturated fat, and about the same number of calories, except they come in smaller 100 calorie packages so I only eat that one. I find them filling enough to be satisfying. The grandsons love them and everybody is happy.","Negative","Negative","Negative","Negative"

15220,"Bali Bound","Positive","Gluten free products can be hit or miss.  I'm fairly new to living the gluten free lifestyle, and I've often been surprised by how bad some gluten free products can be.  I've had good luck with Pamela's products so far.  I noticed several people didn't like Pamela's Coconut Whenever bars, but I loved them!<br /><br />I think the size is just right for a snack, and they are moist and chewy.  The coconut flavor seemed authentic to me, not artificial.  There was just the right amount of chocolate to round out the flavor.  The chewy texture was just right as well, although every now and then I hit a piece of a hull or something that was unexpected.<br /><br />I've pretty much given up on most baked goods since giving up gluten.  I have no idea if I would like these bars as much if I were still able to eat 'regular' food.  Overall, I think they are very good for a gluten free product and it's something I'd like to have again.","Positive","Positive","Positive","Positive"

""If you're feeling down, try throwing yourself into your work.""  These are not fortunes, they are self-help mini-bites.  A fortune is:  ""Your love of travel will soon be satisfied,"" and it doesn't matter if they are predictive or not.  What matters is that they state a fortune.  ""Beware the dog in the corner house,"" would be fun to get.  ""Life is a wiggle"" is boring.<br />The cookies arrived on schedule, as promised, and in good condition in their individual wrappers.

32899,"S. Shelton","Positive","I agree that there's a problem with the chews not all being equal size.  But in our family, that's not a problem.  All bags of chews, no matter the brand, seem to have this issue...thick and thin together...but we just use it to our advantage.  We have 2 dogs: the one we raised from a pup likes a big, thick chew, the other is older and a rescue, and though we take him to the dentist regularly, his teeth are just very sensitive so the smaller chews work out great for him.  The ones in the middle they share equally.<br /><br />Another thing, each chew is coated differently.  The smaller more wrinkled up chews have more of it than the thicker chews which have a smoother surface.  But our boys don't seem to notice these small differences and we're happy as long as they're happy.  In fact, one of the best parts of our evening is watching them settle down beside each other, each with their respective CET chew, engaged in knawing away the time.<br /><br />Is CET messing with the consumer by not correctly sizing their chews 100%?  I dunno.  But they are without a doubt the favorite treat in this household and we'll keep buying them here since we can't find a better price elsewhere!","Positive","Positive","Positive","Positive"

It used to be that we were always ordering the same brands, once we liked a certain one.  But I ventured to try the Wolfgang Puck line.  While this flavor is touted as a medium roast, it seems to be more on the bold side with a little bitterness.  It is still not a bad coffee, just not as good as the ""Rodeo Drive"" or ""Breakfast in Bed"" k-cups which has no bitterness.

It came in a cheap-looking blue cardboard box with the same inside wrapping you'd find in a McDonald's toy. Worst of all, some of the candies had jack-o-lantern wrapping. That's fine in October, but by New Year's, it looks like old Halloween candy! I couldn't use it as a gift because I didn't want them to think I was giving them leftover Halloween candy.<br /><br />If you're ordering the box for yourself, by all means, go for it. The quality of the candies is just fine. But if you're ordering it to give as a gift, watch out! I think they just ship you the oldest (sometimes out-of-season) box they have.

She would warm it up on the old gas stove.  You'd think that all of the major brands of ""pancake syrup maple flavored,"" would stop using high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />One day last week I had the chance to take my granddaughter out grocery shopping with me.  Not one of my best things to do, but I thought, how would she learn to shop and look for the good stuff, not the crap that's advertised on television, but the products that really work and the one's that are good for you.  Reading the labels is a major chore as what you thought was in the product wasn't even close to being in the product. Somebody has to teach her and it was my lucky day.<br /><br />Take for example, pancake syrup or what used to be called maple syrup in my day.  You look at the labels, today... never is there mention of a maple tree, not even close, all fructose or high fructose corn syrup.  So, I told her that maple syrup comes from sugar maple tree sap that has the water content reduced and I asked her if she could find a reference to a maple tree in the contents.  Well, you know the answer, there isn't any on the major or store brands.<br /><br />I told her that Coombs makes a maple syrup that reminded me of when I was growing up.  Well, after a few grocery stores later and checking their stock we came across the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Now, I know, I've been telling my granddaughter about how I grew up, so she wasn't going to let me off the hook so easily.  You guessed it... I made pancakes and we used the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup, warmed up on the stove just like grandma did.  She said, ""That's the best Maple Syrup I've ever tasted.""  I told her that's because it's real maple syrup.<br /><br />A lesson learned, and I was pleased to make pancakes for my granddaughter, this is one of those moments you don't forget in life.","Positive","Positive","Positive","Positive"

So my dreams of independent play have not yet been realized.","Negative","Negative","Negative","Negative"

So the sweetness of M&BS is a little much for me - however the maple flavor and smell is strong and pleasant and that goes a long way towards making up for it.<br /><br />Preparation is easy enough.

I still buy the tuna and just feed it occasionally as an extra treat. The food itself looks and smells just like tuna for humans, maybe even a little better. Some of it has tiny little (whole) shrimp and some pieces of codfish - it also has a lot of tuna oil, which I guess is what the cats like about it because the first thing they do is lap up all the ""gravy"".

29654,"thouston","Positive","I was very confused when I wrote my first review. Yes, everything below was true but it was no fault of the product. The KEY to kettle style popcorn machines is proper temperature. The process to get big kernels is simple and is as follows:<br /><br />- Let the kettle heat empty for 5 minutes.<br />- Put popping oil in kettle and let it heat for another 5 minutes.<br />- Put in popcorn and salt and wait for the magic to happen.<br /><br />All of the problems I was experiencing below went away when I followed the procedure above. Popcorn pops real big and fluffy. I'm all out of corn right now and will be giving the Chiefs Choice brand a try to compare the two.<br /><br />--------------------OLD INACCURATE REVIEW BELOW -----------------<br />I had read a few other reviews here on Amazon that said this popcorn wasn't very good (Coconut oil flavor) and I have to agree. I thought I could suck it up and eat all of it but there is no way I will be able to do it. It's just nasty plain and simple. I'm using a Paramount popper and it works very well.<br /><br />My findings:<br /><br />- Kernels pop real small and are very chewy. Not big light and fluffy.<br />- Overall taste of the popcorn is not very good. Popcorn has a nasty coconut oil flavor to it. I thought maybe reducing the premeasured oil to half would help but it still has a coconut oil flavor to it.<br /><br />Overall, it's pretty bad and maybe I just ended up with an old batch or something because when you taste the popcorn you could swear that it's old. I'm hearing there is a brand called Chief's Choice and I will order some of that today and give it a try.","Neutral","Neutral","Neutral","Neutral"

1826,"Jane Tompkins","Negative","I love Amazon and I love the reviews from people, I've been introduced to alot of great products b/c of the reviews, but this time? Total, complete LET DOWN! Popchips having 4.5 stars is just down right perplexing!?! The should not get more than a 3, but generally 1-2. I sorta want to give it a 1, but the packaging is very pretty and aesthetically pleasing so I through in the extra point.<br /><br />I ordered these thinking that'd they'd be maybe a slightly better version of Baked Lays. Man was I wrong... I've tried most of the Baked Lays flavors, my go-to's at first were 1.) original baked lays and 2.) sour cream baked lays (since those are my favorite regular lays). But then  I discovered BBQ Baked Lays. And seriously, those are FANTASTICALLY great. BBQ Baked Lays are packed with SO much flavor.<br /><br />These Popchips taste like slightly burnt airpocket chips. Literally they do. Because they aren't as good as Baked Lays I can definitely see eating much less of them (which could be a benefit), but I say just use portion control-- and zip lock bag a bunch of Baked Lays.<br /><br />I'm trying to think of ways to go into more detail, but there's really not much more I can say.<br /><br />****SUMMARY****<br /><br />How do Popchips taste? Like slightly burnt air chips. (it's sort of a weird taste, takes ALOT of getting used to)<br /><br />Would I suggest buying them? No. If you're eager to try them, I say buy a bag from your local grocery store. A week or so after I ordered these on here I saw them at m local Krogers, so they're definitely expanding.<br /><br />Nutrition Information: 1 bag (.8 oz/ 23g) = 100 calories, Total Fat = 3g (5%), Sodium = 210 mg (9%), Total Carbohydrate = 16g (5%), Dietary Fiber = 1 g (4%), Sugar = 2g, Protein 1 g, Vitamin A , Vitamin C, Calcium, and Iron = 2 %.<br /><br />If you buy a big bag of BBQ Popchips and big bag of BBQ Baked Lays, here are the nutrition information side-by-side:<br /><br />**POP CHIPS:**<br />Serving Size: 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories= 120, Total Fat = 4.5g (6%), Sodium 280mg (11%), Total Carbohydrate 20g (6%),<br />Dietary Fiber 1g (4%), Sugars 2g, Protein 1g<br /><br />**BAKED LAYS:**<br />Serving Size= 1oz/28g/about 19 chips, Calories = 120, Total Fat 3g (5%),  Sodium 210mg (9%), Potassium 230mg, Total Carbohydrate 22g (7%), Dietary Fiber 2g 8%, Sugars 3g, Protein 2g, Vitamin C 4%, Calcium 2%<br /><br />So these two are very close, but Baked Lays wins because it virtually has not sodium, since potassium 230mg offsets the Sodium 210mg, leaving 20g of Potassium. Plus there's more Fiber and more Vitamin C. And most importantly they taste better.<br /><br />I for one have to be careful about my sodium intake so the fact that Baked Lays has potassium in it is a huge benefit.<br /><br />At the end of the day make a decision for yourself, but I'd strongly advise you to purchase a bag from the store first. Maybe even compare your favorite flavor in both Baked Lays and Popchips... I can almost guarantee you that Baked Lays will win hands down.<br /><br />(Hopefully Amazon starts selling well-priced variety single-serve bags of Baked Lays soon. For now I found one from a seller, but the price seems a little high (but there are 40 bags instead of 20): <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003TVDHIO"">Smart Mix Variety Pack, 30-Count: 7-Baked Lay's Classic, 6-Baked Cheetos, 6-Baked Ruffles, 6-Baked Doritos Nachos Cheese & 5-Rold Gold Tiny Twists (Pack of 2)</a> )","Negative","Negative","Negative","Negative"

20345,"Tracy Rowan ""dargelos""","Positive","I'm a serious label-reader, even more so for my cat than for myself, so before I ordered Petite Cuisine, I went to their website to see what they had to say for themselves.  I was pleased to read that they use no wheat gluten in their food, nor meat by-products; neither belongs in pet food.  They also make a point of saying that they use no products from China.  It's a reassurance I appreciate in the light of the recent spate of pet deaths linked to product coming out of China.<br /><br />What they do use was also reassuring.  White meat chicken, veggies, olive or soybean oils, vitamins and minerals.  The sesame chicken does contain rice which isn't something that should necessarily  be fed often, but it's a minor consideration.  While it's never said that the ingredients are ""human grade"" they are listed as safe for humans to eat.  I don't know about anyone else but I wouldn't want to feed my pets anything that wasn't safe for me to eat.<br /><br />The carton arrived and was marked as ""Product of Thailand"" which was a bit of a surprise since no mention of Thailand appears on their site.  They are, however, quick to point out that no child labor is used in production of any of the food.  (It's also listed as ""dolphin safe.""  This is a pretty politically correct company.)<br /><br />Of course the proof of the pudding, or in this case, the cat food, is the eating.  My response as I opened the cans was the the sesame chicken looked and smelled very tempting.  The chicken pot pie, not so much.  It smells wonderful, but is very watery.  Again, this is a minor consideration.  If my cat likes it, that's the important thing.  He's a picky boy, in part because he can't eat beef or lamb, so he's limited to poultry and certain types of fish.  He doesn't tend to like the souped-up, holistic foods that add things like rosemary and acai and all those things which humans so cheerfully add to their own foods.  But this stuff is pretty basic, and, well let's just say, he doesn't hate it.  I can probably add it to the rotation without causing much consternation, and know that he's getting a quality meal.<br /><br />Your mileage -- or your cat's -- may vary, of course.  Cats are perverse little beasts, and you just never know what they're going to take violent dislike to.  I can't tell you if your cat will like this food or not, but I can tell you that it looks like quality product made by people who have high standards.  Yes, it's pricey, but if you feel, as I do, that your cat deserves the consideration you'd give to any member of the family, you probably won't balk at the cost.<br /><br />The rest is up to your cat.","Neutral","Positive","Neutral","Positive"
2949,"A. Ali","Negative","I made the mistake of believing that Science Diet was the best choice for my cat after the woman at the animal shelter mentioned it as the food they use. After doing some research I realized that Science Diet is no better than any grocery store generic brand or Iams (I would NOT recommend ANY of these options).<br /><br />The main ingredients are Chicken By-Product and Corn. Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers.

Office hours later until about five.  I usually carry my own lunch to eat in the office or on the run.  No quiet breaks for me, I usually have students in the office.  When my blood sugar starts dropping, I don't have much time to wait, so a little bar like this serves really well to give me a little boost.  I prefer not to have chips or cookies or crackers, as I need to watch both sugar intake and salt intake.  I'm not gluten-intolerant. That said, I enjoy these little bars by Pamela's Products.  It truly is good for ""Whenever.""  This particular flavor is soft and very much like a soft-baked oatmeal cookie with chocolate chips and coconut in it--but without the gluten!  The flavor is natural, not very fake-berry flavored or peanut-butter-covering-up-the-flavor-of soy-protein flavored.  It's probably five or six bites for me, and a couple crumbs will fall off as I nosh, but that's okay for me, now that I know.  A bit high in calories (180), but the number of carbs is low (23, before fiber content figures in), so it's a pretty safe treat when you have blood sugar considerations.  It's a darned tasty treat.

I am 60 years old and about 50 pounds overweight.  I find it hard to keep my energy up day after day while running and exercising.  First of all these are so tasty without being overly sugary.  I was surprised though to see that the ingredients weren't mostly honey and the first ingredient listed which is suppose to be what the item has the most of is tapioca syrup.  I guess with the package calling it honey stinger I was thinking that it was pure honey with some taste enhancers.  Still, everything is organic which I suppose should add to it's value.  I found that I felt no energy boost during my activities but I can say that without a doubt that these make you feel like you can keep going and going.  It's not something that feels like you are really energetic but more like you just got a good days rest and are ready to get going.  I don't like feeling like I'm on a sugar high with that nervous feeling in my chest and these do not do that.  I think they make you feel healthy and are a good addition to your diet for exercising.  The only drawback to me is the cost of these $16 for 12 bags makes it hard to justify the purchase as often as you would like to have them.  I will purchase again when my grocery money allows.  I would recommend to buy if you are looking for a healthy pickup to keep you going all day and not just for a quick boost.","Neutral","Neutral","Neutral","Neutral"

Add together PIA and MESS with an end outcome of weak cup o' Joe = I'm not a very happy buyer.","Negative","Negative","Negative","Negative"

12667,"bernie ""webviator""","Positive","Called ""Frozen Tongue"" this was the second flavored released by ALTOIDS in 1998.<br /><br />ALTOIDS mints were first produced in England at the turn of the 19th century during the reign of King George III.<br /><br />Ingredients: sugar, artificial flavor, gum Arabic, gelatin, corn syrup, natural flavor.<br /><br />My first encounter with wintergreen was in a heat rub (I smelled it but did not eat it.) Then I found it in some circular candy with a hole in the middle. Now I keep a tin of ALTOIDS at work, home and in the car.","Positive","Positive","Positive","Positive"
